#Java Basics Project 

This project is a simple Library Management System implemented in Java, demonstrating the use of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts such as inheritance, constructors, static variables, and method overriding. The system manages a collection of books and eBooks, allowing users to display information, calculate discounted prices, and view all available books in a library.

#Future Enhancements

Add support for borrowing books and tracking borrowed status.
Implement user authentication for managing library access.
Store book details in a database for persistence.
